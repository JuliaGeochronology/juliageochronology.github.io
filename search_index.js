It relies on the principle that the rate at which a particular radioactive element decays is constant over time, allowing scientists to determine the age of minerals and rocks based on the ratio of the original amount of the element to its present day amount.","category":"page"},{"location":"principles/","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"principles/#Primer-on-nuclides-and-radioactive-decay","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Primer on nuclides and radioactive decay","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"principles/#Nuclides","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Nuclides","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"principles/","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","text":"Fundamental to geochronology are the concepts of stable nuclides and radionuclides.","category":"page"},{"location":"principles/","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","text":"A nuclide (wiki: nuclide) is an atom with a specific number of protons, neutrons, and energy state.[1] Isotopes, isotones, and isobars are all forms of nuclides.","category":"page"},{"location":"principles/","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","text":"Isotopes have the same Z-number (protons), but different number of neutrons\nThey are different masses of the same element.\ne.g. ^85_37textRb text and  ^87_37textRb\nIsotones have the same N-number (neutrons), but different Z-numbers.\nThey are different elements with the same number of neutrons.\ne.g. ^85_37textRb text and  ^86_38textSr\nIsobars have the same A-number (atomic mass), Z + N = A, they will be different elements.\ne.g. ^87_37textRb text and  ^87_38textSr","category":"page"},{"location":"principles/","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","text":"The configuration of a nuclide will either make it stable or unstable.
