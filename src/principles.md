# Principles of Radiometric Geochronology

Radiometric geochronology is a branch of geochemistry that uses the decay of radioactive elements to date geological events and processes.
It relies on the principle that the rate at which a particular radioactive element decays is constant over time, allowing scientists to determine the age of minerals and rocks based on the ratio of the original amount of the element to its present day amount.

# Primer on nuclides and radioactive decay
## Nuclides
Fundamental to geochronology are the concepts of *stable nuclides* and *radionuclides*.
A *[nuclide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclide)* is an atom with a specific number of protons, neutrons, and energy state.
*Isotopes*, *isotones*, and *isobars* are all forms of nuclides.
* *Isotopes* have the same Z-number (protons), but different number of neutrons
    * They are different masses of the same element.
    * e.g. ``{^{85}_{37}}\text{Rb} \text{ \& } {^{87}_{37}}\text{Rb}``
* *Isotones* have the same N-number (neutrons), but different Z-numbers.
    * They are different elements with the same number of neutrons.
    * e.g. ``{^{85}_{37}}\text{Rb} \text{ \& } {^{86}_{38}}\text{Sr}``
* *Isobars* have the same A-number (atomic mass), ``Z + N = A``, they will be different elements.
    * e.g. ``{^{87}_{37}}\text{Rb} \text{ \& } {^{87}_{38}}\text{Sr}``

The configuration of a nuclide will either make it *stable* or *unstable*.
If the nuclide is *unstable* it is called a *radionuclide* and will undergo some form of radioactive decay.
There are ``\sim905`` naturally occurring nuclides, of which 90 are theoretically stable.
