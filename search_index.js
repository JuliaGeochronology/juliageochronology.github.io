It relies on the principle that the rate at which a particular radioactive element decays is constant over time, allowing scientists to determine the age of minerals and rocks based on the ratio of the original amount of the element to its present day amount.","category":"page"},{"location":"principles/#Primer-on-nuclides-and-radioactive-decay","page":"Fundamentals of Radiometric Geochronology","title":"Primer on nuclides and radioactive decay","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"principles/#Nuclides","page":"Fundamentals of Radiometric Geochronology","title":"Nuclides","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"principles/","page":"Fundamentals of Radiometric Geochronology","title":"Fundamentals of Radiometric Geochronology","text":"Fundamental to geochronology are the concepts of stable nuclides and radionuclides.
