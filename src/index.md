# JuliaGeochronology

The [JuliaGeochronology](https://github.com/JuliaGeochronology) organisation is an effort by geoscientists to bring fast and accurate open source tools for the analysis of radiometric geochronology data to the Julia language.

This site also serves as the central documentation site for the organisation.
On this site you can find links to the individual package documentation, as well as a primer on radiometric geochronology.

Visit [github.com/orgs/JuliaGeochronology/people](https://github.com/orgs/JuliaGeochronology/people) to see the current public members of JuliaGeochronology.
