It relies on the principle that the rate at which a particular radioactive element decays is constant over time, allowing scientists to determine the age of minerals and rocks based on the ratio of the original amount of the element to its present day amount.","category":"page"},{"location":"principles/#Primer-on-nuclides-and-radioactive-decay","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Primer on nuclides and radioactive decay","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"principles/#Nuclides","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Nuclides","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"principles/","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","text":"Fundamental to geochronology are the concepts of stable nuclides and radionuclides.","category":"page"},{"location":"principles/","page":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","title":"Radiometric Geochronology Fundamentals","text":"A nuclide is an atom with a specific number of protons, neutrons, and energy state[1].

If the nuclide is unstable it is called a radionuclide and will undergo some form of radioactive decay. There are sim905 naturally occurring nuclides, of which 90 are theoretically stable to all but alpha decay.
